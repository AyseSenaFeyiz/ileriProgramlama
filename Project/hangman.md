**Project Name:**  Hangman Game


**How to play?**


Computer takes part as a hangman in this game.


When the game starts, the computer determines a random category and shows it to player on the screen as a hint. 
Then it selects a random word from this category.


The player will guess a letter and type it using the textbox, then push the try button. 
If that letter is in the word then computer writes the letter in everywhere it would appear.


If the letter doesn’t match with the letters of the word, the computer adds a body part to the gallows (head, body, left arm, right arm, left leg, right leg).


The computer also adds the letter to “already guessed” list.


The player will continue guessing letters until they can solve the word. 
The player can make only six incorrect guesses.


The hangman wins if the full body is hanging from the gallows. 
The player wins if they guess the word before the person is hung.
